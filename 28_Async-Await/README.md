# Async/Await :

* A way of working with async code more elegantly.

* Can be used anywhere in JS.(Backend as well as frontend)

* Allows us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner.

* What we mean is that it allows us to write the code in a way it looks synchronous but it still works asynchronously.
