# Handlebars :

* Does not follow minimal HTML approach rather it follows normal HTML with some templating logic.

* Since handlebar uses normal html we can just use the error.html code and add some custom templating code.

* Also since we are already passing in code we don't need to change the JS files.

* The way we pass the dynamic content doesn't change for templating engines.

* To add dynamic content in handlebar template we use {{}}.
